# Mortal Kombat
Project based off what was meant to be a very simple homework about teaching randomness in C#. I did what I often do and very VERY much overcomplicated it. My first big work in coding. The name was simply the name of the homework. Not very fitting for the content, I know.

The basis of the work was.
You enter a number.
The "Ai" picks a random number.
If your number was higher, you win.

I did a complete fighting system featuring Health, Mana, Stamina and a ton of moves.
Also contains multiplayer, a few settings and a very unfinished and terribly coded online mode. This code sucks, you dont need to criticize me on that, I know it sucks.

Does not feature comments. As I said it was one of my first works.
Does feature alot of spaghetti, if you're hungry go ahead, check it out.
