# Mortal Kombat
Project based off what was meant to be a very simple homework about teaching randomness in C# Console. I did what I often do and very VERY much overcomplicated it. My first big work in coding. The name was simply the name of the homework. Not very fitting for the content, I know.

The basis of the work was.
You enter a number.
The "Ai" picks a random number.
If your number was higher, you win.

I did a complete fighting system featuring Health, Mana, Stamina and a ton of moves.
Also contains multiplayer, a few settings and a very unfinished and terribly coded online mode. This code sucks, you dont need to criticize me on that, I know it sucks.

Probably doesnt have alot of decent comments. As I said it was one of my first big programs.
Also I HAD tried making the code prettier a bit using functions but pretty much gave up mid way through.
